    <p>This website talks about Sam, so I'm going to talk about him. Sam has ketchup hair. He likes ketchup. All the campers draw on a picture of his face that is put on the board. They added ketchup in his hair, a beard, and clown nose, and other things. Sam trys to erase everything and he erases something, but we add everything back. We draw on the picture in front of him with exbo markers, so he can erase. </p>
